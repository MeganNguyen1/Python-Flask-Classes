# variable naming conventions = how you can make a variable
# 1. you csn write any alphabet lowercase and uppercase in the variable
# example: num, number string, megan, urvashi, UVRASHI
# 2. Numbers can be added in a variable but not in the first place
# example: megan45, go457tu,
# 45tyu --> this is wrong
